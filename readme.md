## Phase Four Watch

When the FDA approves a new molecular entity, it can impose an additional requirement known as a post-marketing requirement or phase four study. This means that the drug manufacturers are required to conduct large scale and often multi-year studies "to assess possible serious risks associated with the drugs," according to the FDA. Unfortunately the FDA seldom follows up on this requirement, and many drug companies do not comply with it. This script scrapes the FDA website and archive for new molecular entity approval letters over the past ten years that include the word `postmarketing`, and downloads them to a csv file. The formats and url for the years 2015-2019 and 2011-2014 are different, so they had to be broken out into separate methods.
